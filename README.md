# Technology stack

## Frontend

- ReactJs

## Backend

- NodeJs
- ExpressJS

## Database

- MongoDb
- MySQL

## Deployment

- AWS EC2

# Design Choices:

### Why NoSQL in a database?

- We chose NoSQL over a relational architecture because of its own access languages for interpreting data being stored.
- It offers a developer-centric database, which simplifies database design and access to application programming interfaces.
- Before employing databases, developers do not need to be concerned about their internal workings.
- NoSQL databases allow you to work on what you need rather than pushing a schema on the database.

### Why is MongoDB used?

- MongoDB allows different data hierarchies. - Secondary indexes provide for flexibility in datamodel.
- Because Mongo DB is schemaless, we do not define the schema at the outset.

### Why MERN Stack - Performance and User Interface Rendering
- React JS is the best when it comes to UI layer abstraction. Because React is only a library, you may build the application and structure the code anyway you like. As a consequence, in terms of UI rendering and performance, it exceeds Angular.

- Cost-effective
Because MERN Stack uses only one language throughout, Javascript, a firm will benefit from hiring only Javascript experts rather than specialists for each technology. This choice will save you both time and money.

- Open Source and Free
MERN employs only open-source technology. This feature allows a developer to use open sources to find answers to challenges that may emerge during development.
